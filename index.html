    <h1>Happy Coding</h1>
    <p>
      My introduction to coding took place thanks to my daughter. Knowing that I
      was looking for a new challenge, she suggested I took a look at SheCodes
      coding courses. I had always been very curious about coding and although I
      found it incredible challenging, or perhaps because I did, I inscribed,
      celebrating the feeling of now having a clue about what it'd be about.
      Because of the vast experience I have in different working fields, I
      usually know something of any topic I come across. But things were
      different this time, and a subtle memory of a excursion I once enrolled in
      to the Pyramids, and ended up with a bus full of Swedish tourists, came to
      mind. It is very rare that I don't understand a word foreigners are
      saying, but this time, I now only didn't understand sounds either. Only
      one sound stuck, as I heard it many times, and apparently it meant "but".
      Does it say somethingabout the Swedish culture? We'll discuss that another
      time. For now, SheCodes, and the free introduction course from the hand of
      Matt Delac. ...
