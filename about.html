    My introduction to coding took place thanks to my daughter. Knowing that I
    was looking for a new challenge, she suggested I took a look at SheCodes
    coding courses. I had always been very curious about coding and although I
    found it incredible challenging, or perhaps because I did, I inscribed,
    celebrating the feeling of now having a clue about what it'd be about.
    Because of the vast experience I have in different working fields, I usually
    know something of any topic I come across. But things were different this
    time, and a subtle memory of a excursion I once enrolled in to the Pyramids,
    and ended up with a bus full of Swedish tourists, came to mind. It is very
    rare that I don't understand a word foreigners are saying, but this time, I
    now only didn't understand sounds either. Only one sound stuck, as I heard
    it many times, and apparently it meant "but". Does it say somethingabout the
    Swedish culture? We'll discuss that another time. For now, SheCodes, and the
    free introduction course from the hand of Matt Delac. ... My introduction to
